## Challenge Description

The challenge is to create a dashboard that visualizes the most common types of car accidents in Seattle and where they occur. Our goal is to design an accessible platform that represents useful information that aims to show attributes of various collisions occurring in the city of Seattle. This information will hopefully help auto engineers make safety adjustments, and policymakers adjust traffic safety precautions. Overall this project will lead to public awareness of the leading factors of car crashes.
